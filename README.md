# PART1_Variables
Create a small code snippet showing the different ways variables operate.

In computer science, there are two types of code. Code that acts as
representation of state, or memory, and code that actually acts; it
does something to, on, or from that state within the program. A good
analogy for the dichotomous nature of programming is that variables
are like nouns. They simply are. Functions and/or methods, which 
represent verbs, or action, simply do. They perform operations, 
access memory, call other functions, compare values, etc. Both these
types of code make up a program.

Variables again represent a state of something. In this code snippet,
we used variables to store Strings. The letters we typed in-between the
quotes were that memory. The function we then used was System.out.println(),
which accessed that memory from an address it found using our variable
name. 

We also added strings together, or more precisely, we concatenated strings,
meaning we appended one to the end of the other. The "+" symbol acted
as the function (though again with the technicalities, it's called an
operator) and combined the memory from both variable addresses into
one long string that was then printed to the screen. 

You have to store values in memory a LOT in programming. Anytime you're
going to do this, you're going to use variables. There are many more types
of variables than Strings however, and what type of variable you use will
depend on what type of data or memory you are trying to store.
