# PART1_Variables
Create a small code snippet showing the different ways variables operate.

In computer science, there are two types of code. Code that acts as a
representation of state, or memory, and code that actually acts; it
does something to, on, or from that state within the program. A good
analogy is that variables are like nouns - they simply represent something - while 
functions and/or methods, which represent verbs, or action, simply 
do; they perform operations, access memory, call other functions, compare 
values, etc. Both these types of code make up a program. The string "Hello
World!" can be considered a noun, as it's a variable stored in memory, while
the println() function can be considered a verb, it takes that variable and
prints it onto screen, doing something with that data.

Variables store the state of something, and in this code snippet,
we used variables to store Strings. The letters we typed in-between the
quotes were that memory. The function we then used was System.out.println(),
which accessed that memory from an address it found using our variable
name. 

We also added strings together, or more precisely, we concatenated strings,
meaning we appended one to the end of the other. The "+" symbol acted
as the function (though it's technically called an operator) and combined 
the memory from both variable addresses into one long string that was then 
printed to the screen. 

You have to store values in memory a LOT in programming. Anytime you're
going to do this, you're going to use variables. There are many more types
of variables than Strings however, and what type of variable you use will
depend on what type of data or memory you are trying to store.
